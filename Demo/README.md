## Demo001_quickstart

This is the quickstart with furniture parts examples. I use this demo for documentation purposes. This is good start for feature testing or learning FreeCAD woodworking.

## Demo002_constraints

This demo example shows how to create dowels, pilot holes and countersinks at FreeCAD. Also You can generate `c - report type` to see named constraints report.

## Demo003_multi

This demo example shows how to create custom furniture element with dowels, pilot holes and countersinks and use it to create furniture. This demo use such FreeCAD features as: `Draft :: Clone` and `Part :: Mirroring` on whole `Body`. So, You can see how to use whole `Body` as the furniture part.

## Demo004_pads_mirror

This demo example shows how to use Spreadsheet for furniture resize. You can change top table size, legs offset just by changing values at Spreadsheet. Also if You generate report again You got new dimensions. This demo also shows how to use `PartDesign :: MultiTransform` FreeCAD feature correctly to create legs or top table supporters very quickly.

## Demo005_edgeband

This demo example shows how to correctly apply edgeband under the FreeCAD. To generate report You have to select `white` for furniture color because the furniture is all white with black edgeband. This demo example is the real-life furniture I made in my garage. It is very modular and the structure is very durable because each shelf rests on the sides.

## Demo006_holes

This demo example shows how to create furniture with all details. This furniture has applied edgeband. Also there are used custom elements with pilot holes and countersinks and advanced FreeCAD features. You can test detailed report `d - report type` with advanced features in practice here. This example is based on the real-life furniture I made in the past. It has open back part for wires, good for TV set or any media.
